# Welcome to StackTHPred: Identifying tumor homing peptides through stacking ensemble approach with optimal features
This THP prediction tool developed by a team from the Chinese University of Hong Kong (Shenzhen)

The present study employed five general protein descriptors as features including amino acid composition(AAC), pseudo-amino acid composition(PAAC), physicochemical properties(PHYC), BLOSUM62 and Z-scale.
