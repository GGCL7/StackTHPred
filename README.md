# Welcome to StackTHPred: Identifying tumor homing peptides through stacking ensemble approach with optimal features
This THP prediction tool developed by a team from the Chinese University of Hong Kong (Shenzhen)

The present study employed five general protein descriptors as features including amino acid composition(AAC), pseudo-amino acid composition(PAAC), physicochemical properties(PHYC), BLOSUM62 and Z-scale.



We developed three models based on three datasets, and you can find the pre-stored models at [THP_model](https://github.com/GGCL7/StackTHPred/tree/main/THP_model)
